# Versioning & Changelog

When making changes that will be deployed:

1. **VERSION** (repo root): Bump per Major.Feature.Patch (v0 = beta, v1 = Strava onboarded)
2. **CHANGELOG.md** (repo root): Add entries under `[Unreleased]` as you work. When releasing, move them into `[X.Y.Z]` with the release date.

**Changelog sections:** Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed, Security. Use what fits.

**Do not touch:** Terraform/infra (owner maintains manually).

See `docs/versioning.md` for full workflow.
