# GitHub Commit & PR

When the user says they're ready to commit to GitHub (or similar: "ready to push", "write my commit", "PR summary"):

1. **Commit message**: Give a single-line git commit message (conventional commit style: feat/fix/chore/refactor etc.)
2. **PR summary**: Give a brief PR description summarizing the changes

Base both on the actual changes in the session/context.
