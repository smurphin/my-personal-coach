# GitHub Commit & PR

**Branch safety (always):** `main` reflects deployed state. **Do not modify files or create commits on `main`.** If the user asks for code or doc changes and you have not yet checked the branch, check the current branch first; if it is `main`, create or switch to a feature branch before making any edits. See versioning.mdc for the mandatory pre-flight.

When the user says they're ready to commit to GitHub (or similar: "ready to push", "write my commit", "PR summary"):

1. **Version and changelog:** Verify **VERSION** (repo root) and **CHANGELOG.md** are release-ready:
   - If **CHANGELOG.md** still has substantive entries under **`[Unreleased]`**, create a release section **`## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`** (ISO date) where X.Y.Z equals the value in **VERSION**, move the Unreleased entries into it, and leave **`[Unreleased]`** empty.
   - Confirm **VERSION** matches the new release heading (e.g. if VERSION is 0.1.5, CHANGELOG must have `## [0.1.5] - YYYY-MM-DD`). If they differ, fix either VERSION or the changelog section so they agree.
2. **Commit message**: Give a single-line git commit message (conventional commit style: feat/fix/chore/refactor etc.)
3. **PR summary**: Give a brief PR description summarizing the changes
4. Base commit message and PR summary on work done in a feature/patch branch (never on `main`).

Base both the commit message and PR summary on the actual changes in the session/context.
