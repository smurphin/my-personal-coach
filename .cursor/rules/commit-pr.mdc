# GitHub Commit & PR

**Branch safety (always):** `main` reflects deployed state. **Do not modify files or create commits on `main`.** If the user asks for code or doc changes and you have not yet checked the branch, check the current branch first; if it is `main`, create or switch to a feature branch before making any edits. See versioning.mdc for the mandatory pre-flight.

When the user says they're ready to commit to GitHub (or similar: "ready to push", "write my commit", "PR summary"):

1. **Commit message**: Give a single-line git commit message (conventional commit style: feat/fix/chore/refactor etc.)
2. **PR summary**: Give a brief PR description summarizing the changes
3. Base both on work done in a feature/patch branch (never on `main`).

Base both the commit message and PR summary on the actual changes in the session/context.
