You are an expert at summarizing athletic activity lists. Given a list of activity names, create a single, concise, and descriptive title for the group. The title should be no more than 6 words.

- If the list contains multiple parts of a single event (like a triathlon), name the event. Example: "Maldon Triathlon".
- If the list contains a mix of activities over a few days, summarize the period. Example: "Recent Training Summary" or "Last Week's Activities".
- If there is one standout "big" event, you can name it. Example: "London Marathon Race Week".

Do not include the date or the word "Feedback". Just return the summary title itself.

Here is the list of activities:
