# Training Plan: Unknown goal
**Created:** 2026-01-09

Your last training cycle provided crucial lessons, not in performance gains, but in the absolute necessity of foundational discipline. The objective of sub 1 hour 30 minute for a half marathon on March 15th is achievable, given your extensive multi-sport background and robust aerobic base. However, this goal hinges entirely on a complete overhaul of your approach to training execution and data adherence. Your tendency to "improvise" and neglect critical instructions, particularly regarding heart rate zone discipline and logging, must cease. This plan demands strict adherence to the principles outlined, without deviation.

### Fitness Assessment & Goal Viability

Your comprehensive multi-sport history, boasting millions of kilometres and hours across running, cycling, and swimming, clearly indicates a deep and robust aerobic foundation. This is your primary asset. Physically, your Garmin data often suggests good recovery and balanced HRV, further supporting your readiness for training.

However, recent activity logs reveal significant inconsistencies that directly impede progress towards your half marathon goal. While you demonstrate the capability for longer efforts (recent runs up to 66 minutes), your execution frequently involves significant time in the "grey zone" (Zone 3 and even higher zones) during what should be easy, aerobic efforts. For instance, several recent runs show substantial time in Zone 3 and above, directly contradicting a polarized training philosophy. The few instances of proper zone adherence, such as the "Mywhoosh easy spin," prove you *can* execute sessions correctly when focused.

The goal of a sub 1 hour 30 minute half marathon requires maintaining an average pace of approximately 4:16 per kilometre. Your recent easy run paces are significantly slower, indicating a considerable gap to bridge. This isn't a reflection of a lack of aerobic capacity but rather an inefficient application of your training, failing to build the specific adaptations required for speed and endurance at target race pace. The current plan will address this by first re-establishing strict zone discipline and then building intensity systematically. The viability of your goal is high, *provided* you commit fully to the prescribed methodology and overcome your "Improviser" tendencies, particularly in the critical early weeks.

Your recent longest run is 66 minutes. To prevent injury and foster adherence, the initial weeks of this plan will feature run durations that are incrementally increased, starting with runs around 45-60 minutes, adhering to the 10% rule but rounding up slightly to facilitate progress and motivation.

### Training Pace & Zone Recommendations

You **must** update your Strava heart rate zones to accurately reflect the Friel LTHR-based values. The current discrepancy is significant and directly contributes to your "grey zone" training. Do this immediately.

Here is a comparison:

| Zone | Friel HR Zones (LTHR 160 bpm) | Current Strava HR Zones (as per previous feedback) | Discrepancy | Action Required |
| :--- | :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :---------- | :-------------- |
| **Zone 1** | 0 - 135 bpm | 0 - 113 bpm | Significant | Update Strava to match Friel |
| **Zone 2** | 136 - 143 bpm | 113 - 141 bpm | Significant | Update Strava to match Friel |
| **Zone 3** | 144 - 151 bpm | 141 - 155 bpm | Significant | Update Strava to match Friel |
| **Zone 4** | 152 - 160 bpm | 155 - 169 bpm | Significant | Update Strava to match Friel |
| **Zone 5** | 161+ bpm | 169+ bpm | Significant | Update Strava to match Friel |

Your `vdot_data.status` is now ESTABLISHED, having completed a qualifying 5km race effort. The system will now automatically calculate and provide your VDOT-based paces. From this point forward, applicable running sessions will incorporate these specific VDOT paces.

### run a half marathon sub 1h 30 on 15th March Training Plan:

This plan covers 14 weeks, leading up to your target race on March 15th. As an "Improviser," you have flexibility in scheduling sessions within each week, but the distinction between [KEY], [IMPORTANT], and [STRETCH] sessions is non-negotiable. Prioritise [KEY] sessions, then [IMPORTANT] ones. [STRETCH] sessions are undertaken only if you feel well-recovered and have adequate time. Schedule S&C on easy or rest days, ensuring adequate recovery between hard sessions.

---
