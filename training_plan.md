Right, let's get to it. Here is your plan.

### Fitness Assessment & Goal Viability
Your training history shows a significant multisport background, including demanding events like the Helvellyn Triathlon. This has built a substantial aerobic base, which is an excellent foundation. Your endurance capacity is not in question.

However, your recent running-specific performance, notably the 22:23 parkrun on 30th August, indicates a current 10k potential closer to 46-47 minutes. The goal of a sub-39 minute 10k (3:54/km pace) is therefore a significant stretch from your current capabilities. It is not a realistic short-term objective. This plan is the first phase of a longer-term project to build the necessary running-specific speed and economy. We will focus on consistent, high-quality training. Your recent track session is a good start; we will build on that structure.

### Training Pace & Zone Recommendations
Your heart rate zones require a minor adjustment for precision. The variance in Zone 3 is sufficient to warrant an update to align with the Friel model, which is critical for avoiding unproductive 'grey zone' training.

**Zone Comparison**
| Zone | Current Strava Zones (bpm) | Recommended Friel Zones (bpm) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1    | 0 - 136                    | 0 - 136                       |
| 2    | 136 - 142                  | 136 - 142                     |
| 3    | 142 - 152                  | 144 - 150                     |
| 4    | 152 - 160                  | 152 - 160                     |
| 5    | 160+                       | 160+                          |

Update your training device settings to match the Friel zones. The value 143bpm should be treated as the top of Zone 2.

Your data confirms that pace-based training is not yet appropriate (`vdot_data.status: "HR Training Recommended"`). For now, all intensity sessions will be prescribed by heart rate and feel.
**Action:** In week 4 of this plan, you will perform a 5k time trial. This will provide the baseline data needed to calculate your VDOT and establish precise training paces for the next block.

### 10k road race in under 39 minutes Training Plan: Weeks 1-6
Organise these sessions into your week to suit your schedule. Ensure at least one day of rest or very easy activity between the [KEY] session and any other demanding workout. S&C should be done after an easy run or on a rest day.

*   **[IMPORTANT] Aerobic Run:** 60 minutes, disciplined in Zone 2.
*   **[IMPORTANT] S&C Session:** Perform one of the routines below. Priority: **Routine 1**.
*   **[STRETCH] Easy Run:** 40 minutes, Zone 2.

*   **[STRETCH] S&C Session:** Perform a second routine.

*Note on future progression:* Once your fitness base improves significantly, we can explore more advanced structures like double threshold days (two quality sessions in one day). For now, consistency with one key session per week is the priority.
