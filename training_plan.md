Here is your training plan.

### Fitness Assessment & Goal Viability

Your training history indicates a strong multisport background, evidenced by significant cycling and swimming volume, including the Helvellyn Triathlon. This provides a substantial aerobic base which is a considerable asset.

Reviewing your recent training (last 4-6 weeks), you have recovered from the Helvellyn effort and are re-establishing consistency. The track session on 13 September (10 x 400m) shows you are capable of handling high-intensity work. However, your most relevant recent performance is the 22:23 5k parkrun on 30 August. This performance equates to a VDOT of approximately 43, suggesting a current 10k capability in the region of 46:30.

The goal of a sub-40:00 10k requires a VDOT of 50. Achieving this by early November represents a significant performance leap in a very short timeframe. While your aerobic engine is robust, developing the specific running economy, speed, and lactate tolerance required is a major undertaking. The goal is exceptionally ambitious and likely not viable in this window. A more realistic target would be to aim for sub-43:00, which would represent excellent progress. This plan is designed to maximise your potential and build the foundations for future attempts at the sub-40 barrier.

### Training Pace & Zone Recommendations

Your heart rate zones are set correctly. The minor discrepancy in Zone 3 is immaterial to our training philosophy, as we will not be targeting this zone. The crucial zones for polarised training (Zone 2, Zone 4, Zone 5) are aligned. No update is necessary.

| Zone | Your Current Strava Zones (bpm) | Friel LTHR-Based Zones (bpm) | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | 0 - 136 | 0 - 136 | OK |
| **2** | 136 - 142 | 136 - 142 | OK |
| **3** | 142 - 152 | 144 - 150 | Minor difference, acceptable |
| **4** | 152 - 160 | 152 - 160 | OK |
| **5** | 160+ | 160+ | OK |

Your `vdot_data.status` is "HR Training Recommended". We will therefore base the first phase of this plan on Heart Rate. To establish precise training paces, you will perform a **5km Time Trial in Week 4**. This will give us the data needed to transition to VDOT-based pace targets for the subsequent training block.

### Run a sub 40 minute 10k at the beginning of November Training Plan: Weeks 1-6

Schedule these sessions throughout your week. Ensure at least one, preferably two, easy or rest days between [KEY] sessions. Perform S&C on easy run days or rest days, but avoid doing it the day before a [KEY] session.

**S&C Plan Library**

Select from these routines for your S&C sessions. For the first two weeks, prioritise Routine 1. In weeks 3 and 4, prioritise Routine 2. In weeks 5 and 6, you can incorporate Routine 3 on one of your S&C days. Use Routine 4 as an alternative for a lighter day or as a second session.
