Welcome to kAIzen Coach, your AI-powered personal training partner! Here’s how to get started.

Step 1: Connect Your Strava Account

From the home page, click "Login with Strava".

You will be taken to a Strava authorization page. Grant the requested permissions to allow kAIzen Coach to view your profile and activity data.

Step 2: Set Your Goal

After logging in, you'll be directed to the onboarding page.

Fill out the form with your primary training goal, how many sessions you can realistically do per week, and any other lifestyle context that might affect your training.

Click "Analyze My Strava & Build My Plan". The AI will now analyze your data and generate your personalized plan. This may take a minute or two.

Step 3: View Your Plan

Your new training plan will be displayed on the screen. It is broken down week-by-week.

Each session is marked as [KEY], [IMPORTANT], or [STRETCH] to help you prioritize.

You can access your plan at any time by clicking the "View My Plan" link from the home page.

Step 4: Get Feedback

After you complete and upload a workout to Strava, you can get feedback on it.

Navigate to the "Get Latest Feedback" page. The AI will analyze your most recent activity against the goals of your plan and provide a detailed breakdown and an execution score.

The AI may occasionally suggest updates to your plan based on your performance, which will be applied automatically.

Step 5: Review Your History

All feedback is saved in your "Coaching Log". You can visit this page to see a complete history of your AI-coached sessions.
