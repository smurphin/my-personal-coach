Q: Is my data safe?
A: Yes. We use the secure Strava OAuth2 protocol to connect to your account. Your training data is stored securely in our database and is only used to generate your plans and feedback.

Q: What do the session priorities mean?

[KEY]: These are the most important workouts of the week, typically high-intensity sessions that drive the biggest fitness gains. Prioritize these above all others.

[IMPORTANT]: These are foundational workouts, like your weekly long run or primary strength session. They are crucial for building endurance and resilience.

[STRETCH]: These are supplementary sessions, like extra recovery runs or mobility work. They are beneficial if you have the time and energy, but are the first to drop if your schedule is tight.

Q: The plan doesn't have workouts assigned to specific days. Why?
A: kAIzen Coach provides a weekly list of sessions to give you the flexibility to schedule them around your life. As a general rule, you should allow at least one easy or rest day between [KEY] sessions.

Q: What if I miss a workout?
A: Don't worry! Consistency over perfection is the goal. Simply move on with the plan. If you consistently miss [KEY] sessions, the AI will notice this trend in the feedback loop and may adjust future weeks to be more manageable.

Q: Can I change my goal?
A: Yes. From the home page, click "Generate a New Plan". This will take you back to the onboarding form where you can input a new goal. The AI will summarize your just-completed training cycle and use it as context to build your new plan.
