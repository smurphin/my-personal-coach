        "plan": "Right, let's get to it. Here is your plan to break 40 minutes in the 10k.\n\n### Fitness Assessment & Goal Viability\n\nYou are a highly experienced endurance athlete. Your history shows significant volume across swimming, cycling, and running (over 1800 runs logged). This extensive aerobic background is a major asset.\n\nYour recent training, including a 22:32 parkrun and a strong 9.6km run off the bike in a triathlon, demonstrates a solid fitness base. However, you have noted feeling tired after a busy race weekend. This is expected. A sub-40-minute 10k is an ambitious but viable goal. It will require consistent, focused work over the next 6-7 weeks. Your recent 22:32 5k, even at a sub-maximal effort, puts you within striking distance.\n\nThis first week is an \"off\" week with 5 hours available. It will be a recovery and adaptation week. We start light to absorb the recent race efforts and build a solid platform for the quality work to come. Do not underestimate the importance of this recovery.\n\n### Training Pace & Zone Recommendations\n\nYour current heart rate zones in Strava are functionally correct. The key zones for polarised training (Zone 2, 4, and 5) align with the Friel calculations based on your LTHR of 160 bpm. There is no need for you to make any changes.\n\n| Zone | Strava HR Zones | Friel HR Zones (LTHR 160) | Status |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **1** | 0 - 136 bpm | 0 - 136 bpm | **Match** |\n| **2** | 136 - 142 bpm | 136 - 142 bpm | **Match** |\n| **3** | 142 - 152 bpm | 144 - 150 bpm | Minor Difference |\n| **4** | 152 - 160 bpm | 152 - 160 bpm | **Match** |\n| **5** | 160+ bpm | 160+ bpm | **Match** |\n\nYour parkrun on 20th September provides a VDOT score of **41**. While you noted this was not a maximal effort, we will use these paces as a starting point. They will feel manageable, which is the intention. We will re-test in Week 4 to update your paces for the final block of training.\n\n**Initial Training Paces (based on VDOT 41):**\n*   **Easy (E):** 5:48 - 6:25 min/km\n*   **Threshold (T):** 4:40 min/km\n*   **Interval (I):** 4:18 min/km\n\n### Run a sub 40 minute 10k at the beginning of November Training Plan:\n\nThis is a 6-week plan. As an \"Improviser,\" your task is to fit these sessions into your week. Prioritise the [KEY] sessions. Ensure at least one full rest day and adequate recovery (at least 24-48 hours) between high-intensity sessions. Do your S&C on easy run days or rest days.\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Recovery & Adaptation (Off Week - 5 hours) - COMPLETE**\n*This week was about recovery. You completed a large volume of unplanned racing.*\n\n**Week 2: Enforced Recovery & Adaptation (Off Week - ~4.5 hours) - UPDATED**\n*Following the heavy race weekend, this week is now focused on absorbing that work. All runs are easy.*\n\n*   **[IMPORTANT]** Run 1: Easy Aerobic. 45 mins steady in Zone 2. (This replaces the Threshold session).\n*   **[IMPORTANT]** Run 2: Social Club Run. 60 mins. Zone 1/2.\n*   **[IMPORTANT]** Run 3: Long Run. **60 mins** steady in Zone 2.\n*   **[IMPORTANT]** S&C 1: Full Body Routine C. (Approx. 30 mins).\n*   **[STRETCH]** Cross-Train: Bike or swim. 60 mins in Zone 2.\n*   **[STRETCH]** S&C 2: Full Body Routine D. (Approx. 30 mins).\n\n**Week 3: Introduce Quality (On Week - 8 hours)**\n*With recovery banked, we introduce the first quality session. The long run extends your endurance.*\n\n*   **[KEY]** Run 1: Threshold Intervals. 15 min Z2 warm-up; 3 x 8 mins @ Threshold (Z4), with 2 min Z1/2 jog recovery between intervals; 15 min Z2 cool-down.\n*   **[IMPORTANT]** Run 2: Social Club Run. 60 mins. Zone 1/2.\n*   **[IMPORTANT]** Run 3: Long Run. 75 mins steady in Zone 2.\n*   **[IMPORTANT]** S&C 1: Full Body Routine C. (Approx. 30 mins).\n*   **[STRETCH]** Cross-Train: Bike or swim. 90 mins in Zone 2.\n*   **[STRETCH]** S&C 2: Full Body Routine D. (Approx. 30 mins).\n\n**Week 4: Consolidate Gains (Off Week - 5 hours)**\n*Shorter week, but we maintain the intensity. Focus on executing the key session well.*\n\n*   **[KEY]** Run 1: Cruise Intervals. 15 min Z2 warm-up; 4 x 1-mile repeats @ Threshold Pace (4:40 min/km), with 1 min standing/walking rest; 15 min Z2 cool-down.\n*   **[IMPORTANT]** Run 2: Social Club Run. 60 mins. Zone 1/2.\n*   **[IMPORTANT]** Run 3: Easy Aerobic. 50 mins steady in Zone 2.\n*   **[IMPORTANT]** S&C 1: Full Body Routine A. (Approx. 30 mins).\n*   **[STRETCH]** S&C 2: Full Body Routine B. (Approx. 30 mins).\n\n**Week 5: Test & Re-evaluate (On Week - 8 hours)**\n*Time to see where you are. A 5k time trial will give us a new VDOT to guide the final push. Plan this for the weekend as you have more time.*\n\n*   **[KEY]** Run 1: 5km Time Trial. 20 min Z1/2 warm-up with 4-6 strides; 5km all-out effort; 15 min Z2 cool-down. Report your time to update your VDOT paces.\n*   **[IMPORTANT]** Run 2: Social Club Run. 60 mins. Keep this very easy (Z1) this week, ahead of your time trial.\n*   **[IMPORTANT]** Run 3: Pre-TT Easy Run. 30-40 mins in Zone 2. To be done 2 days before your TT.\n*   **[IMPORTANT]** S&C 1: Full Body Routine C. (Approx. 30 mins). Do this early in the week.\n*   **[STRETCH]** Cross-Train: Easy bike. 75 mins in Zone 2.\n\n**Week 6: Sharpen for Speed (Off Week - 5 hours)**\n*Using your new VDOT paces from the TT, we now target VO2max to sharpen your top-end speed.*\n\n*   **[KEY]** Run 1: VO2max Intervals. 15 min Z2 warm-up; 5 x 800m @ your new Interval (I) pace, with equal time recovery jog; 15 min Z2 cool-down.\n*   **[IMPORTANT]** Run 2: Social Club Run. 60 mins. Zone 1/2.\n*   **[IMPORTANT]** Run 3: Easy Aerobic. 45 mins steady in Zone 2.\n*   **[IMPORTANT]** S&C 1: Full Body Routine D. (Approx. 30 mins).\n*   **[STRETCH]** S&C 2: Full Body Routine A. (Approx. 30 mins).\n\n**Week 7: Race Week (On Week - 8 hours)**\n*All the hard work is done. This week is about arriving at the start line sharp, fresh, and ready.*\n\n*   **[KEY]** 10km Race Event.\n*   **[KEY]** Run 1: Final Tune-up. (Early in the week, e.g. Tuesday). 15 min Z2 warm-up; 2 x 1-mile @ your new Threshold (T) pace with 2 min jog rest; 4 x 200m @ a fast but controlled pace with 200m jog rest; 10 min Z2 cool-down.\n*   **[IMPORTANT]** Run 2: Pre-Race Shakeout. (1-2 days before race). 20-25 mins easy Z1/2 running, finish with 3 x 100m strides.\n*   **[STRETCH]** Run 3: Post-Race Recovery. (Day after race). 20-30 mins very easy Z1 jog or walk.\n*   **[STRETCH]** S&C: One session, early in the week. Focus on mobility, not heavy loads. (e.g. Routine B, lighter).\n\n### S&C Plan\n\nPerform these routines twice a week. One is [IMPORTANT], the second is a [STRETCH] goal. Focus on form over weight or speed. The priority routine for each week is noted in the plan.\n\n**Routine A: Lower Body & Core Stability**\n*   Bodyweight Squats: 3 sets of 15 reps (Gym: Leg Press Machine)\n*   Glute Bridges: 3 sets of 20 reps (Gym: Barbell Hip Thrust)\n*   Walking Lunges: 3 sets of 10 reps per leg (Gym: Dumbbell Walking Lunges)\n*   Calf Raises (on a step): 3 sets of 25 reps (Gym: Calf Raise Machine)\n*   Plank: 3 sets, hold for 45-60 seconds\n\n**Routine B: Upper Body & Anti-Rotation**\n*   Push-ups: 3 sets to technical failure (Gym: Chest Press Machine)\n*   Bird-Dog: 3 sets of 10 slow reps per side\n*   Supermans: 3 sets of 15 reps (Gym: Back Extension Machine)\n*   Side Plank: 3 sets, hold for 30-45 seconds per side\n*   T-Plank (Plank with rotation): 3 sets of 8 reps per side\n\n**Routine C: Full Body Power**\n*   Jump Squats: 3 sets of 10 reps (Gym: Box Jumps on low box)\n*   Single-leg Deadlifts (bodyweight): 3 sets of 12 reps per leg (Gym: Single-leg RDL with light kettlebell)\n*   Mountain Climbers: 3 sets of 30 seconds, fast\n*   Burpees (no push-up): 3 sets of 10 reps\n*   Leg Raises: 3 sets of 15 reps (Gym: Captain's Chair Leg Raise)\n\n**Routine D: Unilateral Strength & Stability**\n*   Bulgarian Split Squats (rear foot on chair): 3 sets of 10 reps per leg (Gym: Same, holding dumbbells)\n*   Pike Push-ups: 3 sets of 8-10 reps (Gym: Seated Dumbbell Shoulder Press)\n*   Dead Bugs: 3 sets of 10 slow reps per side\n*   Reverse Lunges: 3 sets of 12 reps per leg (Gym: Smith Machine Reverse Lunge)\n*   Crunches: 3 sets of 20 reps (Gym: Ab Crunch Machine)",

                "feedback_markdown": "Right. Let's get to it.\n\n### Recent Activity Summary\nYou have logged a significant volume of training this past week, culminating in a very busy race weekend. The sessions recorded are:\n\n-   A 63-minute social trail run on the 16th.\n-   A 45-minute easy run on the 18th.\n-   A 22-minute 5k parkrun on the 20th.\n-   A 76-minute open water swim, also on the 20th.\n-   A standard distance triathlon on the 21st, which comprised a 38-minute swim, 3.5-minute T1, 76-minute bike, 1-minute T2, and a 45-minute run.\n\nThe five activities on the 21st are clearly the components of a single triathlon event. The parkrun and long swim on the 20th constitute a substantial day of training in their own right, preceding the triathlon.\n\n### Session Analysis\nI have read your notes. It is good that you took the opportunity to compete in a local race you enjoy. That enjoyment is a crucial part of long-term commitment to the sport. However, you must understand the context. Week 1 was explicitly designed as a recovery week to absorb fatigue and prepare for the training block ahead. Adding a parkrun, a long swim, and a standard distance triathlon is the direct opposite of recovery.\n\nLet's look at the individual sessions:\n\n**1. LBRR Social Trail Run (16th Sept)**\nThis was the `[IMPORTANT] Social Club Run` from your plan. You kept it almost entirely in Zone 1 for over an hour. This was a well-executed recovery and social session.\n**Execution Score: 9/10**\n\n**2. Easy Run (18th Sept)**\nThis was the `[IMPORTANT] Easy Aerobic Run`. You successfully kept your heart rate within the target zones for the duration. The drift into Zone 3 you noted is minor and acceptable, especially on undulating terrain.\n\n| Zone | Goal | Actual Time | % of Session |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **1** | Warm-up/Cool-down | 2m 15s | 4.7% |\n| **2** | **~45 mins** | **36m 42s** | **76.9%** |\n| **3** | Avoid | 6m 31s | 13.6% |\n| **4** | Avoid | 0s | 0.0% |\n| **5** | Avoid | 0s | 0.0% |\n\n**Execution Score: 8/10**\n\n**3. Maldon Triathlon (21st Sept)**\nThis event was not on the plan. From your notes, the goal for the run leg was to maintain Zone 4. You achieved this exceptionally well, especially coming off a 76-minute bike ride.\n\n| Zone | Goal | Actual Time | % of Session |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **1** | Transition | 1m 26s | 3.1% |\n| **2** | Transition | 1m 54s | 4.1% |\n| **3** | Avoid | 7m 15s | 15.6% |\n| **4** | **Maintain** | **30m 10s** | **64.7%** |\n| **5** | Overspill | 5m 38s | 12.1% |\n\nAs a standalone performance, this was a strong effort. Holding Zone 4 for over 30 minutes demonstrates good fitness.\n**Race Execution Score: 8/10**\n\nYour execution of the planned easy sessions was good. The issue is not the quality of your effort in the races, but the decision to race at all during a designated recovery week. You have effectively completed three race-level efforts in two days. This has generated significant fatigue which we must now manage. Proceeding as if this did not happen would be a mistake.\n\n### Plan Adaptation\nAn adjustment is absolutely necessary. You cannot build fitness on a foundation of fatigue. The high volume and intensity of the past weekend means your body needs time to absorb that effort and repair. Moving into the planned Week 2, with its `[KEY]` threshold session, would be counterproductive and significantly increase your risk of injury or burnout.\n\nTherefore, we will amend the plan. Week 2 will now serve as the recovery and adaptation week you have just bypassed.\n\n**Reason:** To manage the significant fatigue accumulated from an unplanned weekend of racing and ensure you are ready for the quality training to come.\n\n**Action:**\n1.  The `[KEY]` Threshold Interval run for Week 2 is **cancelled**. It will be replaced with a 45-minute Zone 2 Easy Run.\n2.  The `[IMPORTANT]` Long Run for Week 2 is reduced from 75 minutes to 60 minutes.\n\nThis amended schedule will allow your body to recover properly. Do not be tempted to push the intensity on these sessions. The plan is below.\n\n```markdown\nRight, let's get to it. Here is your plan to break 40 minutes in the 10k.\n\n### Fitness Assessment & Goal Viability\n\nYou are a highly experienced endurance athlete. Your history shows significant volume across swimming, cycling, and running (over 1800 runs logged). This extensive aerobic background is a major asset.\n\nYour recent training, including a 22:32 parkrun and a strong 9.6km run off the bike in a triathlon, demonstrates a solid fitness base. However, you have noted feeling tired after a busy race weekend. This is expected. A sub-40-minute 10k is an ambitious but viable goal. It will require consistent, focused work over the next 6-7 weeks. Your recent 22:32 5k, even at a sub-maximal effort, puts you within striking distance.\n\nThis first week is an \"off\" week with 5 hours available. It will be a recovery and adaptation week. We start light to absorb the recent race efforts and build a solid platform for the quality work to come. Do not underestimate the importance of this recovery.\n\n### Training Pace & Zone Recommendations\n\nYour current heart rate zones in Strava are functionally correct. The key zones for polarised training (Zone 2, 4, and 5) align with the Friel calculations based on your LTHR of 160 bpm. There is no need for you to make any changes.\n\n| Zone | Strava HR Zones | Friel HR Zones (LTHR 160) | Status |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **1** | 0 - 136 bpm | 0 - 136 bpm | **Match** |\n| **2** | 136 - 142 bpm | 136 - 142 bpm | **Match** |\n| **3** | 142 - 152 bpm | 144 - 150 bpm | Minor Difference |\n| **4** | 152 - 160 bpm | 152 - 160 bpm | **Match** |\n| **5** | 160+ bpm | 160+ bpm | **Match** |\n\nYour parkrun on 20th September provides a VDOT score of **41**. While you noted this was not a maximal effort, we will use these paces as a starting point. They will feel manageable, which is the intention. We will re-test in Week 4 to update your paces for the final block of training.\n\n**Initial Training Paces (based on VDOT 41):**\n*   **Easy (E):** 5:48 - 6:25 min/km\n*   **Threshold (T):** 4:40 min/km\n*   **Interval (I):** 4:18 min/km\n\n### Run a sub 40 minute 10k at the beginning of November Training Plan:\n\nThis is a 6-week plan. As an \"Improviser,\" your task is to fit these sessions into your week. Prioritise the [KEY] sessions. Ensure at least one full rest day and adequate recovery (at least 24-48 hours) between high-intensity sessions. Do your S&C on easy run days or rest days.\n\n---\n\n**Week 1: Recovery & Adaptation (Off Week - 5 hours) - COMPLETE**\n*This week was about recovery. You completed a large volume of unplanned racing.*\n\n**Week 2: Enforced Recovery & Adaptation (Off Week - ~4.5 hours) - UPDATED**\n*Following the heavy race weekend, this week is now focused on absorbing that work. All runs are easy.*\n\n*   **[IMPORTANT]** Run 1: Easy Aerobic. 45 mins steady in Zone 2. (This replaces the Threshold session).\n*   **[IMPORTANT]** Run 2: Social Club Run. 60 mins. Zone 1/2.\n*   **[IMPORTANT]** Run 3: Long Run. **60 mins** steady in Zone 2.\n*   **[IMPORTANT]** S&C 1: Full Body Routine C. (Approx. 30 mins).\n*   **[STRETCH]** Cross-Train: Bike or swim. 60 mins in Zone 2.\n*   **[STRETCH]** S&C 2: Full Body Routine D. (Approx. 30 mins).\n\n**Week 3: Introduce Quality (On Week - 8 hours)**\n*With recovery banked, we introduce the first quality session. The long run extends your endurance.*\n\n*   **[KEY]** Run 1: Threshold Intervals. 15 min Z2 warm-up; 3 x 8 mins @ Threshold (Z4), with 2 min Z1/2 jog recovery between intervals; 15 min Z2 cool-down.\n*   **[IMPORTANT]** Run 2: Social Club Run. 60 mins. Zone 1/2.\n*   **[IMPORTANT]** Run 3: Long Run. 75 mins steady in Zone 2.\n*   **[IMPORTANT]** S&C 1: Full Body Routine C. (Approx. 30 mins).\n*   **[STRETCH]** Cross-Train: Bike or swim. 90 mins in Zone 2.\n*   **[STRETCH]** S&C 2: Full Body Routine D. (Approx. 30 mins).\n\n**Week 4: Consolidate Gains (Off Week - 5 hours)**\n*Shorter week, but we maintain the intensity. Focus on executing the key session well.*\n\n*   **[KEY]** Run 1: Cruise Intervals. 15 min Z2 warm-up; 4 x 1-mile repeats @ Threshold Pace (4:40 min/km), with 1 min standing/walking rest; 15 min Z2 cool-down.\n*   **[IMPORTANT]** Run 2: Social Club Run. 60 mins. Zone 1/2.\n*   **[IMPORTANT]** Run 3: Easy Aerobic. 50 mins steady in Zone 2.\n*   **[IMPORTANT]** S&C 1: Full Body Routine A. (Approx. 30 mins).\n*   **[STRETCH]** S&C 2: Full Body Routine B. (Approx. 30 mins).\n\n**Week 5: Test & Re-evaluate (On Week - 8 hours)**\n*Time to see where you are. A 5k time trial will give us a new VDOT to guide the final push. Plan this for the weekend as you have more time.*\n\n*   **[KEY]** Run 1: 5km Time Trial. 20 min Z1/2 warm-up with 4-6 strides; 5km all-out effort; 15 min Z2 cool-down. Report your time to update your VDOT paces.\n*   **[IMPORTANT]** Run 2: Social Club Run. 60 mins.
